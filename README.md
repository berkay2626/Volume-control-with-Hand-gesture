# Volume control with hand gesture 

I've built an OpenCV Application with Python. The user can control the volume of his systems like Laptop or PC by making some Hand Gestures. 

# Introduction
The Application detects the Hand via camera. Then according to the distance between user's Index finger and Thumb it displays the volume in the volume bar on the screen, 
to set this volume as the system's volume user has to bend his pinky finger simultaneously.

# Librarys
- OpenCV lib(for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe lib(for Hand Tracking)
- Pycaw lib(to link up with the system's volume)
